# Project 3: Spots

This project shows my learning experience creating responsive design.

**Technology used**

- CSS
- HTML
- Vscode
- github

**Techniques used**

In this project, I learned that instead of using explicit sizing, proportional sizing can be used. This allows elements to shrink/grow to the space available on whatever screen is used to view the page. This can be done with decimals, percentages and using units of the viewers screen. I also learned to use media queries for when the entire layout may need to be adjusted for extremely different screen types(example:a site that was built for desktop view being viewed on a mobile screen).
